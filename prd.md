Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Smart Recipe Assistant

1. Introduction
   This document outlines the product requirements for the "Smart Recipe Assistant," a Python-based LangChain agent designed to assist users with cooking tasks by leveraging multimodal input and output. The primary goal is to provide an intelligent culinary guide that can process images of ingredients, answer text-based queries, and generate detailed recipes and cooking instructions.
2. Product Vision
   To become the go-to AI culinary assistant, simplifying the cooking process for users by intelligently suggesting recipes based on available ingredients, providing real-time cooking guidance, and answering culinary questions through a natural, multimodal interface.
3. Key Features & Multimodal Capabilities
   3.1. Image Input Capabilities
   FR-001: Ingredient Recognition: The system shall allow users to upload an image of ingredients they possess.
   FR-001.1: The system shall accurately identify and list the ingredients present in the uploaded image.
   FR-002: Recipe Suggestion from Ingredients: Based on the identified ingredients, the system shall suggest a list of relevant recipes.
   FR-002.1: Recipe suggestions shall prioritize recipes that primarily use the identified ingredients, minimizing the need for additional purchases.
   FR-003: Dish Identification (Optional/Future): The system shall allow users to upload an image of a prepared dish.
   FR-003.1: The system shall attempt to identify the dish and provide a corresponding recipe or similar recipes.
   3.2. Text Input Capabilities
   FR-004: Recipe Search: The system shall allow users to search for recipes using text-based queries.
   FR-004.1: Users shall be able to specify recipe names, cuisines, or general dish types.
   FR-004.2: Users shall be able to include dietary restrictions (e.g., "vegan," "gluten-free," "low-carb") in their search queries.
   FR-005: Cooking Clarifications & Questions: The system shall answer user questions regarding recipe steps, ingredients, or cooking techniques.
   FR-005.1: Examples include "What does 'saut√©' mean?", "How do I chop an onion?", "Is this ingredient interchangeable with something else?".
   FR-006: Dietary Preference Specification: Users shall be able to explicitly state their dietary preferences, which the system will consider for all recipe suggestions and generations.
   3.3. Text Output Capabilities
   FR-007: Detailed Recipe Generation: The system shall generate step-by-step recipes based on user input (ingredients, search queries, preferences).
   FR-007.1: Recipes shall include ingredients lists, preparation steps, cooking times, and serving suggestions.
   FR-008: Explanations & Definitions: The system shall provide clear, concise, and accurate explanations for cooking terms, techniques, and ingredient substitutions.
   FR-009: Shopping List Generation: The system shall generate a shopping list for a chosen recipe, highlighting ingredients the user may not possess based on previous input (e.g., identified ingredients from an image).
4. User Experience (UX) Goals
   Ease of Use: The interface should be intuitive and straightforward, allowing users to easily upload images, type queries, and navigate results.
   Responsiveness: The application should be fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
   Clarity: All generated content (recipes, explanations) should be clear, easy to understand, and actionable.
   Engagement: The assistant should feel like a helpful and knowledgeable culinary guide, encouraging continued use.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
   Performance:
   NFR-001: Image processing and recipe generation should complete within 5-10 seconds for typical inputs.
   NFR-002: Text-based query responses should be near real-time (within 2-3 seconds).
   Scalability:
   NFR-003: The backend infrastructure should be able to handle a growing number of concurrent users and requests.
   Reliability:
   NFR-004: The system should be highly available with minimal downtime.
   NFR-005: Error handling mechanisms should be in place to gracefully manage API failures or unexpected inputs.
   Security:
   NFR-006: User data (e.g., uploaded images, preferences) shall be handled securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.
   NFR-007: Authentication mechanisms shall be implemented if user accounts are introduced.
   Maintainability:
   NFR-008: The codebase should be modular, well-documented, and easy to update and extend.
6. Future Enhancements (Potential)
   Audio Input: Voice commands for queries and ingredient descriptions.
   Video Input: Analysis of cooking technique videos or demonstrations.
   Personalized Learning: The agent learns user preferences over time to provide more tailored suggestions.
   Meal Planning: Ability to plan meals for a week based on dietary goals and available ingredients.
   Community Features: Users can share recipes, tips, and interact with other users.
